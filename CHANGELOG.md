# Changelog

Change log for [ASMAC Cornerstone Groups Condition WordPress Plugin](https://github.com/asmac-org/asmac-cornerstone-groups-condition).

## [1.1](https://github.com/asmac-org/asmac-cornerstone-groups-condition/releases/tag/1.1) - 2023-08-17

### Added

- `Current User Groups Read Current Post` condition.
  Check if current user can read the current post based on the Groups read access setting. With the use of other Groups filters, this can allow a CPT to be partially or fully visible based on that Groups read access setting. Will document that other aspect in a future update.
